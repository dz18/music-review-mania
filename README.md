## About Music Mania

Music Mania is a platform where music enthusiasts can share their opinions on songs, albums, and artists.

It’s a space to connect with others who enjoy discussing music on a deeper level, beyond just listening.

### Features:
- Reviews: Write and read reviews on songs, albums, and artists.
- Metrics: Access music data like popularity, trends, and listener demographics.

It’s about engaging with music in a more thoughtful way, whether you’re just listening or looking to dive into the numbers behind the tunes.
